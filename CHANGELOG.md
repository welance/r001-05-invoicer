## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Initial release.
- `invoicer init` — interactive first-run setup that prompts for API keys and tests each connection.
- `invoicer discover` — lists Clockify clients/projects and Qonto clients.
- `invoicer client extract` — uses Anthropic Haiku to parse free-form company text into structured fields.
- `invoicer client add` — creates a Qonto client with a pre-mutation review panel.
- `invoicer draft` — builds a Qonto draft invoice with one line per Clockify time entry, per-entry 15-minute ceiling rounding, Italian SDI e-invoicing fields, and a rich pre-mutation preview panel. Supports fuzzy project search (alias, name, or id).
- `invoicer finalize` — finalizes a draft invoice with a typed-confirmation gate (you must re-type the invoice number).
- `invoicer mail-draft` — downloads the finalized PDF from Qonto, generates a CSV timesheet from the invoice line items, and creates a Gmail draft (via Gmail API `gmail.modify` scope) with both attachments. The tool physically cannot send email.
- MIT license.
- Italy-first Qonto integration: SDI e-invoicing, VAT exemption codes, intra-EU reverse charge, payment reporting (TP02 / MP05).
- Pure functions for rate math, VAT math, rounding, and payload building — zero LLM tokens on the happy path.
